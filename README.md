# Capstone-project

The Stata code in this repository facilitated the longitudinal analysis of my Master's thesis

Here is the basic information about the data collection and analysis:

- 1. I only analyzed three waves (2009, 2013, 2017) of the HILDA Survey. Because the questions of concern are only concurrently available in these three waves.
- 2. Finally, the main methodology of this study is Random-effect and Fixed-effect models, accompanying with factor analysis. However, when I was exploring the data, I also used t-test, POLS model and so on.
- 3. Don't worry about redundant codes. Although I retained lots of variables that are unrelated to my thesis, I written them down in form of scripts. They used to be my inspiration for doing research, so they may motivate me to do more researches using the HILDA Survey.
- 4. More details about the HILDA Survey see https://melbourneinstitute.unimelb.edu.au/hilda

If you find any bugs or typos, feel free to comment on my work. 

Also, I'm looking to collaborate on more research projects using data from the HILDA Survey.
