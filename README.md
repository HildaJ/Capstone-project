# Capstone-project

The Stata code in this repository facilitated the longitudinal analysis of my Master's thesis

Here is the basic information about the data collection:

- 1. I only analyzed three waves (2009, 2013, 2017) of the HILDA Survey. Because the questions of concern are only concurrently available in these three waves.
- 2. The main methodology of this study is random-effect and Fixed-effect models, accompanying with factor analysis. 


If you find any bugs or typos, feel free to comment on my work. 

Also, I'm looking to collaborate on more research projects using data from the HILDA Survey.
